## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2024-05-30

Bringing in Firebase support. This modifies some external requirements now tied to Google and this is currently done through a specific samples folder. This is initially for WebGL using an external repository created by GitHub user 'rotolonico' [Unity Firebase WebGL](https://github.com/rotolonico/FirebaseWebGL/releases) installed into the project. You will also need a configuration file (.json) in any Resources folder in the project.

### 0.3.0 Added

- Firebase integration for WebGL
- FP_FirebaseConfig.cs
  - Assumes a json file is in a Resources folder
- FP_FireConfig.cs
  - serializable class for holding config information

## [0.2.0] - 2023-11-11

Fixing an issue with zero sized list in stat reporters and accounting for division by zero catches by adjusting the calculators to be a (double, bool) return type to screen against for when we waterfall through different calculations. The false return works it's way up the waterfall.

### 0.2.0 Added

- None

### 0.2.0 Changed

- [@JShull](https://github.com/jshull)
  - FP_Analytics.cs
    - All Calculators return types are now (double,bool)
    - Replaced exception throws with (0,false) returns
  - FP_Stat.cs
    - _statCalculations dictionary is now a (double,bool) to align with calculator returns
  - FP_StatReporter.cs
    - Matching previous updates from FP_Stat
    - All derived classes were updated to match as well
  - FP_StatManager.cs
    - Gave the user an option to destroy on load
  
### 0.2.0 Fixed

- This fixes the null issue within cases of 0 items being added to the stat reporter

    - Sum, //SumCalculator
    - Average, //AverageCalculator
    - AverageTimeBetweenEvents, //TimeBetweenCalculator
    - MaxEvent, //MaxEventCalculator
    - MinEvent, //MinEventCalculator
